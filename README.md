<b>SkunkOS</b><br>
Just that what I would like to use as my daily driver.<br>
<br>
It is not a "distro" in the usual sense. SkunkOS is pure FreeBSD.<br>
Furthermore, it is desktop-agnostic unlike the "common FreeBSD distros".<br>
<br>
Just enhanced with configuration and management tools that offer what SOHO and small organizations need.<br>
Powerful, but nonetheless easy and efficient to use, saving experienced FreeBSD users a lot of work, as well as making unique FreeBSD features easily accessible to less-technical users.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the first component of SkunkOS is necessarily an installer, the <a href=https://github.com/SkunkOS/SkunkInstall>Skunk Installer</a>.<br>
Like all SkunkOS components that will follow over time, it is sort of a "first".<br>
Because, "crazy" innovative things that do not yet exist have to be made first.<br>
The second component is the "Skunk Cloner", which will be released very soon in a few days.<br>
<br>
Then, the "Skunk Configurator", the plugin-based system management web interface with many never-seen-before features will be the next component to follow.<br>
Its first release is scheduled for late spring/early summer.<br>
<br>
While this is in the works, the best way you can assist development is to use the <a href=https://github.com/SkunkOS/SkunkInstall>Skunk Installer</a> and the Skunk Cloner to install and clone your laptop and desktop systems, and report any <a href=https://github.com/SkunkOS/SkunkInstall/issues>issues</a> or add your <a href=https://github.com/SkunkOS/SkunkInstall/discussions>suggestions</a> to the discussion.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much!<br>
